Build a "NBA Betting Dashboard" using React and Tailwind CSS.

1. Connect to my Supabase database using the 'supabase-js' client.
   - URL: [https://meqvmpqyizffzlvomqbb.supabase.co]
   - Key: [sb_publishable_bSPoeHBKUrxsEwn0ZI5cdA_iAAK3wza]

2. Fetch data from the 'bets_history' table.

3. Create a layout with a dark theme (background #111).

4. Display the data as a Grid of Cards.
   - Each card represents a match (Home vs Away).
   - Show the Winner, the AI Prediction, and the User Prediction.
   - Use a Green badge if the User won, Red if lost.

5. Add a stats summary at the top: Count total wins for AI vs User.
